# final slides

--------one of these two applies:
for public slides
The slides created with this repository are licensed under CC-BY-4.0.
--------otherwise
The slides are not published under a free license. They may not be reused or
distributed outside of the group within which they are shown (mostly LHCb),
usage of the material within that group must be done with attribution of the
original author, and the restriction of redistribution and attribution must
apply to the derived work, too.

# source material

--------either
Generally, CERN's public material - for what is relevant here, these are slides
LHCb-TALK-20xx-xxx, papers LHCb-PAPER-20xx-xxx LHCb-DP-20xx-xxx, and public
notes LHCb-PUB-20xx-xxx, are published under the CC-BY-4.0 license.
--------or
Source material remains under the original license and terms of usage

--------always
To be sure, look up the original material.

# double licensing and material not yet covered

--------public
The slides are furthermore double licensed under [CC-BY-SA-4.0](CC-BY-SA.txt).

Material within this directory that is not automatically covered by the
CC-BY-4.0 license by virtue of the license for the final slides or its
publication in any source material, is published under the CC-BY-SA-4.0 with
two file exceptions:
--------or
The above rules for the final slides apply also to any material included in
the slides that is not yet covered by the rules for source material. Code
is an exception here, notably:

--------always
 - `Makefile`
 - `gitlab-ci.yml`

These are considered more program like than creative-content like, and
published under the [AGPL 3](AGPL.txt).

# explanation

Given that all plots and numbers are taken from material published by CERN
under CC-BY-4.0, the restriction to CC-BY-SA-4.0 in the previous paragraph most
importantly apply to

 - the LaTeX source code 
 - the Makefile.
 - the gitlab continuous integration
